# Unix

## Basics
Unix is a very significant language in the evolution of computer science. In a very general sense, UNIX is the language that allows you to navigate your operating system on a raw level. When you navigate Finder on Mac or File Systems on Windows, you're essentially traversing through a user interface of terminal. Since it was created in the 1970s, many 'flavors' of unix have been developed, some of which have materialized into the most operating systems today, including Apple's macOS and Linux.

Unix is a brutally simple language. Every command is very straightforward and guarantees efficient execution. The trick is making sure you know what you're doing. Don't worry. At the start, Unix will definitely come off as very unwieldy and monotonous compared to what you're used to. But trust, once you get the hang of things, you'll forget the days where you slowly point-and-clicked through file systems, in favor of 'ls' and 'cd'-ing through directories. :muscle:
